# ft_sort_int_tab

Welcome to the `ft_sort_int_tab` function repository. This function is a fundamental tool for sorting an array of integers in ascending order. It demonstrates basic sorting algorithms' concepts, providing a hands-on example for beginners in C programming to understand sorting mechanisms.

## Description

The `ft_sort_int_tab` function implements a simple sorting algorithm (similar to bubble sort) to organize the elements of an integer array in ascending order. The function iterates through the array multiple times, swapping elements as necessary until the entire array is sorted. This method is intuitive and demonstrates the basic principles of sorting algorithms, though it may not be the most efficient for large datasets.
